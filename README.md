# Mock Social Media App Code Adventure Project for Treehouse


**These projects are not required to complete your Treehouse Techdegree. They are a supplement to your learning and can be great additions to your portfolio as full projects.**

## **Description** - 
`You're confident in your coding abilities and set off to build the next best social media platform! This mockup has a lot of similarities as Twitter. You'll be given a mockup for mobile devices to follow and execute with precision! You will supply your own profile picture as well as one of your recent achievements for the post that displays an achievement! Have fun with this and give it your best shot!`

## **Getting Started**
When downloading this project from the download link, you'll find that there is only one folder inside. You will be given an images folder with all the icons you'll need as well as the mobile mockup. You will need to supply the other needed images as well as the HTML and CSS files.
 I recommend using Sass for your project as this would be the perfect project to get better familiar with it.
